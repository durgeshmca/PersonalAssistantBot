Artiﬁcial intelligence is a moving target.\\nIndeed, even the deﬁnition of AI itself is volatile and has changed over time.\\nKaplan and Haenlein deﬁne AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external\\ndata, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve speciﬁc goals and\\ntasks through ﬂexible adaptation” (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019). Poole and Mackworth\\n(2010) deﬁne AI as “the ﬁeld that studies the synthesis and analysis of computational\\nagents that act intelligently.” An agent is something (or someone) that acts. An agent\\nis intelligent when:\\n1. its actions are appropriate for its circumstances and its goals\\n2. it is ﬂexible to changing environments and changing goals\\n3. it learns from experience, and\\n4. it makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational limitations.\\n\\nintelligent and an agent.\\n2.1 Introduction to AI\\nThe ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has evolved from humble beginnings to a\\nﬁeld with global impact. The deﬁnition of AI and of what should and should not be\\nincluded has changed over time. Experts in the ﬁeld joke that AI is everything that\\ncomputers cannot currently do. Although facetious on the surface, there is a sense\\n\\nas sense, plan and act on the basis of its initial conﬁguration, it might be said to\\nbe more intelligent than an AI that just has a set of rules that guides a ﬁxed set of\\nactions. However, there are some contexts in which you might not want the AI to\\nlearn new rules and behaviours, during the performance of a medical procedure, for\\nexample. Proponents of the various approaches tend to stress some of these elements\\nmore than others. For example, developers of expert systems see AI as a repository of\\nexpert knowledge that humans can consult, whereas developers of machine learning\\nsystems see AI as something that might discover new knowledge. As we shall see,\\neach approach has strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n10 2 What Is AI?\\nhuman would have to talk to the machine before making a decision. Still, the Turing\\nTest marked an important attempt to avoid ill-deﬁned vague terms such as “thinking”\\nand instead deﬁne AI with respect to a testable task or activity.\\n2.1.2 Strong and W eak AI\\nJohn Searle later divided AI into two distinct camps. Weak AI is limited to a single,\\nnarrowly deﬁned task. Most modern AI systems would be classiﬁed in this category.\\nThese systems are developed to handle a single problem, task or issue and are gen-\\nerally not capable of solving other problems, even related ones. In contrast to weak\\nAI, Searle deﬁnes strong AI in the following way: “The appropriately programmed\\ncomputer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the\\nsame sense human beings have minds” (Searle 1980). In strong AI, Searle chooses to\\nconnect the achievement of AI with the representation of information in the human'"
